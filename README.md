## LLM-Driven Emergency Response

The system now uses AI to dynamically assess emergency situations and determine the most appropriate response:

### How It Works

1. **Emergency Detection**: The system detects emergency keywords in user input
2. **LLM Assessment**: The AI analyzes the situation and determines the best course of action
3. **Dynamic Response**: Responses are generated based on context, not rigid protocols
4. **Intelligent Escalation**: Escalation occurs based on user responsiveness and situation severity
5. **Permission-Based Calls**: Emergency services are only called with explicit user permission

### Key Features

- **Context-Aware**: AI considers the specific emergency type and user input
- **Flexible Protocols**: No rigid step-by-step procedures - AI adapts to the situation
- **Safety-First**: Always prioritizes immediate safety before gathering details
- **User Control**: Emergency calls require explicit user confirmation
- **Intelligent Escalation**: Escalation timing and content adapts to the situation

### Emergency Types Supported

üë§ You: Hello! How are you today?
ü§ñ Assistant: Hello! I'm doing well, thank you for asking. I'm here and ready to help you with any questions or tasks you might have. How can I assist you today?

üë§ You: Can you help me write a Python function?
ü§ñ Assistant: Of course! I'd be happy to help you write a Python function. What kind of function do you need? Please let me know:

1. What the function should do
2. What parameters it should take
3. What it should return
4. Any specific requirements or constraints

For example, are you looking to create a function that:
- Performs calculations?
- Processes data?
- Handles file operations?
- Something else entirely?

Once you give me the details, I can help you write the function and explain how it works!

üë§ You: summary
üìä Conversation Summary:
   Total messages: 4

## Model Selection

By default, the agent uses `gpt-4o`. You can change this by modifying the `OPENAI_MODEL` environment variable.

Available models:
- `gpt-4o` (default, latest and most capable model)
- `gpt-4-turbo` (previous GPT-4 model)
- `gpt-3.5-turbo` (fast and cost-effective)


## Architecture

### Service Layer

The application uses a service-oriented architecture with dedicated services for each external API:

- **`OpenAIService`**: Handles all OpenAI API interactions including GPT-4o responses
- **`ElevenLabsService`**: Handles text-to-speech conversion and voice management
- **`WhisperService`**: Handles speech-to-text transcription

Each service provides:
- **Error handling and retries**
- **API key validation**
- **Configuration management**
- **Logging and monitoring**

### Benefits of Service Layer

- **Separation of concerns**: Each service handles one specific API
- **Better error handling**: Centralized error handling per service
- **Easier testing**: Can mock individual services for testing
- **Reusability**: Services can be used by other components
- **Maintainability**: Changes to API logic are isolated

## Features in Detail

   - Check that your `.env` file exists and contains valid API keys
   - Ensure both `OPENAI_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` are set
   - Copy `env.example` to `.env` and update with your keys

2. **"Authentication failed"**
   - Check if the API key is correct
   - Ensure the API key has sufficient credits

3. **"Rate limit exceeded"**
   - Wait a moment and try again
   - Consider upgrading your OpenAI plan

4. **"Module not found" errors**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.7+

5. **Permission errors when saving files**
   - Check write permissions in the current directory
   - Try running from a different location

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the `chat_agent.log` file for detailed error messages
2. Verify your internet connection
3. Ensure your API keys are valid and have credits
